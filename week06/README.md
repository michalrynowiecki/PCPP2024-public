# Lecture 6: Linearizability

## Goals

The goals of this lecture are:

* Explain and use the notion of linearizability.
* Compare linearizability with other notions of correctness for concurrent objects. 
* Design and use common lock-free data structures.

## Readings

* Herlihy:
  * Chapter 3, complete.

* Leslie Lamport. [How to Make a Multiprocessor Computer That Correctly Executes Multiprocess Programs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2016/12/How-to-Make-a-Multiprocessor-Computer-That-Correctly-Executes-Multiprocess-Programs.pdf). IEEE Transactions on Computers C-28. 1979.
  * This paper introduces sequential consistency. It complements the definition in Herlihy, Chapter 3.
